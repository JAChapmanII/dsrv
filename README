DGI is a test bed for CGI stuff in the D language.

Building:
	make

Running:
	./bin/dgi

	I actually deploy this on a server which is set up to redirect all
	subdirectories in ~jac/ to this program. The URL it is currently hosted at
	is JAChapmanII.net/~jac .

	If you really want to run this on the command line, google around for how
	to fake a CGI environment. Mainly, there are some shell variables you
	should export to fake the POST data.
