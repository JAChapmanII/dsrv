DGI is a test bed for CGI stuff in the D language.

Building:
	make

Running:
	./bin/dgi

	I actually deploy this on a server which is set up to redirect all non-home
	subdirectories to this program. The URL it is currently hosted at is
	JAChapmanII.net .

	If you really want to run this on the command line, google around for how
	to fake a CGI environment. Mainly, there are some shell variables you
	should export to fake the POST data.
